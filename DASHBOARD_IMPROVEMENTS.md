# Dashboard Improvements

## Changes Made

### 1. Gender-Neutral Profile Icon
**Problem:** The dashboard displayed a female avatar image that might not represent all users.

**Solution:** Replaced the avatar image with a gender-neutral SVG user icon.
- Removed: `<img src="src/img/avatar.jpg">`
- Added: Modern gradient circular icon with user silhouette
- Design: Gradient background (primary to secondary color) with white user icon

**Location:** `dashboard.html` - Profile dropdown button (line ~48-57)

---

### 2. Real User Email Display
**Problem:** Profile dropdown showed dummy email "user@email.com" instead of actual logged-in user's email.

**Solution:** Updated JavaScript to display authenticated user's real email.
- Added code in `onAuthStateChanged` to update `#profileEmail` element
- Uses `auth.currentUser.email` from Firebase Authentication
- Email updates automatically when user logs in

**Location:** `src/js/app.js` - Authentication section (line ~10-26)

**Code Added:**
```javascript
// Update profile email with real user email
const profileEmailEl = document.getElementById('profileEmail');
if (profileEmailEl && user.email) {
  profileEmailEl.textContent = user.email;
}
```

### 3. Double-Click to View Task Details
**Problem:** Users had to click the 3-dot menu and select "View Details" to see task descriptions.

**Solution:** Added double-click functionality to task cards for quick access to full details.

**Features:**
- Double-click any task card to open the full details modal
- Shows: Title, Description, List, Due Date, Priority, and Status
- Visual hint: Added `cursor-pointer` class and tooltip "Double-click to view full details"
- Works seamlessly with existing click actions (status update, menu buttons)

**Location:** `src/js/app.js`
- Event listener added: line ~398-404
- Styling updated: line ~189-191

**Code Added:**
```javascript
// Add double-click event to show task details
tasksContainer.addEventListener('dblclick', (e) => {
  const card = e.target.closest('.task-card');
  if (card && card.dataset.id) {
    openTaskDetailsById(card.dataset.id);
  }
});
```
